`lo.music` allows you to search and listen in offline to millions of songs via `Vkontakte`.

## Getting started
======
The application was written with the purpose of listening to music on iPhones/iPad in offline mode via the social network [Vkontakte](https://vk.com/). In the near past, Vkontakte closed access to public audio [api](// https://vk.com/dev/audio_api
). Since then, I was not made any changes. Still, I plan to in the near future to complete this application, with a probability of bias from the main goal. Have fun!

## Requirements
======
- iOS 9.0+
- Swift 3.0+
